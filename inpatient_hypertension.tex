\section{Otherwise}

Holding and restarting meds on admission/discharge.
What BP numbers to target. What do the guidelines
say? What risk are we reducing (what time baseline)?
Heart failure (if bad), even compensated, is different.
How long do various agents take? ACE ARB mnemonics. Beta. Calcium.
Others like clonidine. Which classes are good for ``treating a number?''

It is common.\footnote{Axon RN, Cousineau L, Egan BM. Prevalence and management of hypertension in the inpatient setting: a systematic review. J Hosp Med. 2011;6:417-22. [PMID: 20652961]}

current evidence-based hypertension guidelines do not specifically address inpatient hypertension. best practices for diagnosing and managing nonemergent hypertension in the inpatient setting. examples of common syndromes, suggestions for post-acute management. tendency for inpatient providers to overreact to asymptomatic elevated BP which is often treated with intravenous medications offering little benefit and risking potential harm.  calls regarding elevated BP are often a bane for on-call physicians who may feel compelled to react. Once it is established that elevated BP is nonemergent, hospital providers should consider several factors that might contribute to elevated BP. Treat anxiety, pain, etc. Treat volume overload if present. Restart meds if on hold. Finally, \emph{if BP consistently elevated > 20 mmHg above age and condition appropriate guidelines,} titrate existing meds or add new ones. Care should be taken, though, to avoid over-titration of BP medications realizing that long-acting medications take days to weeks to reach steady-state concentrations. Having described instances of overtreatment of BP, it is somewhat paradoxical that opportunities for improvement in care transitions of HTN care are also apparent. \footnote{Axon et al. Curr Cardiol Rep. 2015 Nov;17(11):94. PMID: 26362300.}

Guidelines 2017 as I understand them say: 135 systolic, 130 if CAD, DM, CKD, 65 years old, or 10-year risk of 10\%.\footnote{guidelines} Therefore if you want one number, 155.

Hospital length of stay (LOS) for patients for whom hydralazine was ordered was 12.0+/-15.9 days for those who received at least 1 dose and 7.1+/-9.0 days for those who did not receive a dose (P<.001). For patients for whom labetalol was ordered, patients receiving at least 1 dose had an LOS of 11.8+/-16.1 days vs 7.9+/-10.4 days for those who did not receive a dose (P<.001).\footnote{Weder et al.

\section{Hypertensive Urgency}

Where does the threshold start, where did it used to start?
What meds would I use? I
don't advocate IV. What would I check for or think about regarding
\emph{emergency?} Steep rise should make you more likely to think of
emergency. Compare to somebody who is ``used to'' that high pressure.

Choice quote: ``Many of these
patients have withdrawn from or are noncompliant with antihypertensive therapy\ldots{}.
[T]reated by reinstitution or intensification of antihypertensive drug
therapy and treatment of anxiety\ldots{}. There is no indication for referral to the emergency
department, immediate reduction in BP in the emergency department, or hospitalization for such
patients.''\footnote{Whelton et al. 2017 ACC (and 10 other societies) Guideline. Hypertension. 2017 Nov 13. This is 192 pages with > 200 pp.\ of supplements. Pp. 137--143 are about emergency/urgency.}

In a registry of 1588 ``patients with acute severe hypertension requiring hospitalization,'' 64\% required multiple drugs, 60\% had reelevation to >180, 59\% had end-organ dysfunction during hospitalization, and 37\% were readmitted within 90 days. Median time to BP <160 was 4 hours. 4\% had iatrogenic hypotension, 6.9\% died in hospital, and 11\% died within 90 days.\footnote{Katz et al. Am Heart J.\ 2009 Oct;158(4):599--606.} Note \emph{ICU or ER setting, and IV meds is an inclusion criterion.}


\section{Stray refs}

no substantial benefit from emergency department referral compared
with sending the patient home from the office for outpatient
management of blood pressure.\footnote{Patel et al. JAMA Intern Med. 2016;176(7):981. PMID
27294333.}

acute tx vs not: no differences in return to the emergency department
at 24 hours and at 30 days, and there were no differences in mortality
at 30 days and at one year.\footnote{Levy et al. Am J Emerg Med. 2015 Sep;33(9):1219-24.  PMID
26087706.}

An RCT.  There was no difference between groups 1 and 2 in the time to
BP control, nor was there a difference at 24 hours in pressure
reduction between groups 1,2, or 3.\footnote{Zeller et al. Arch Intern Med. 1989;149(10):2186. PMID 2679473.}
