Where does the threshold start, where did it used to start?
What meds would I use? I
don't advocate IV. What would I check for or think about regarding
\emph{emergency?} Steep rise should make you more likely to think of
emergency.


\section{Otherwise}

Holding and restarting meds on admission/discharge.
What BP numbers to target. What do the guidelines
say? What risk are we reducing (what time baseline)?
Heart failure (if bad), even compensated, is different.
How long do various agents take? ACE ARB mnemonics. Beta. Calcium.
Others like clonidine. Which classes are good for ``treating a number?''
