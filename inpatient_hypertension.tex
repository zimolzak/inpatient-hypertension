\section{Hypertensive Urgency}

Where does the threshold start, where did it used to start?
What meds would I use? I
don't advocate IV. What would I check for or think about regarding
\emph{emergency?} Steep rise should make you more likely to think of
emergency. Compare to somebody who is ``used to'' that high pressure.

Choice quote: ``Many of these
patients have withdrawn from or are noncompliant with antihypertensive therapy\ldots{}.
[T]reated by reinstitution or intensification of antihypertensive drug
therapy and treatment of anxiety\ldots{}. There is no indication for referral to the emergency
department, immediate reduction in BP in the emergency department, or hospitalization for such
patients.''\footnote{Whelton et al. 2017 ACC (and 10 other societies) Guideline. Hypertension. 2017 Nov 13. This is 192 pages with > 200 pp.\ of supplements. Pp. 137--143 are about emergency/urgency.}

In a registry of 1588 ``patients with acute severe hypertension requiring hospitalization,'' 64\% required multiple drugs, 60\% had reelevation to >180, 59\% had end-organ dysfunction during hospitalization, and 37\% were readmitted within 90 days. Median time to BP <160 was 4 hours. 4\% had iatrogenic hypotension, 6.9\% died in hospital, and 11\% died within 90 days.\footnote{Katz et al. Am Heart J.\ 2009 Oct;158(4):599--606.}







\section{Otherwise}

Holding and restarting meds on admission/discharge.
What BP numbers to target. What do the guidelines
say? What risk are we reducing (what time baseline)?
Heart failure (if bad), even compensated, is different.
How long do various agents take? ACE ARB mnemonics. Beta. Calcium.
Others like clonidine. Which classes are good for ``treating a number?''
